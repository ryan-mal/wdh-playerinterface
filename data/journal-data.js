        description: `After all individually making their own way to table 23 of The Yawning Portal – with the exception of Laplace, who sat at the next table over, 4 seemingly mismatched individuals finally got a chance to meet. Ava, Elroy, Cernunn, Laplace and his cute pink snake Marie. While awkwardly sitting together at the same boot, the tavern started getting loud and rowdy as an experienced party of adventurers started making their way down the large portal. Everyone around started making bets before eventually dying down. However, one group didn't settle down as much. A group of thugs, with black eye-shaped tattoos on their bodies picked a fight with a half-orc later identified as Yagra Strongfist. She managed to take 3 of the thugs out before getting knocked out by the fourth one. As the final thug started celebrating his victory, a Troll, with an entire flurry of Stirges leapt out of the portal and ripped him in half. The barkeep, Durnan, immediately leapt into action with his magical great sword to fight the Troll. While doing so, however, 3 Striges detached from the Troll and noticed Ava, who was trying to drag Yagras unconscious body away. After an epic battle, the threat was subdued, and the patrons went right back to drinking. Durnan offered the individuals a free drink which Curnunn gladly took, and used the opportunity to learn about a symbol from his past.

        Eventually, their contact Volo arrived, who had a request of them. He was worried about his friend Floon Blagmaar, who had gone missing two days prior, and Volo was concerned something had happened as a result of the escalated gang violence in Waterdeep as of late. After promising them 100gp each, with 10gp up front… and a handful of signed autographs, the newly formed group took to their first clue; a shady tavern known as The Skewered Dragon in the Dock Ward - a sketchy part of Waterdeep. On the way there they saw the aftermath of a crime scene with many bloody bodies of people with eye tattoos and people with snake tattoos. After gaining information at the Skewered Dragon, they made their way to The Old Xoblob Shop, where they met Xoblob, a Deep Gnome obsessed with two things: Xanathar and Purple. He even had a large purple plushy of a beholder in his shopfront. While Ava snuck in the back and stole a purple candelabra with three purple candles, Elroy and Cernunn learnt some information that led them to a warehouse in Candle Lane. Apparently after Volo left Floon, he was joined by another, similar looking man, and both were attacked and kidnapped by snake tattooed men.

        After all 4 made it to the warehouse, marked by a Flying Snake with an arrow through its head, the group made quite a bit of a ruckus before getting inside. When they finally did, they were greeted to many dead bodies identified to be Black Network agents (Zhents/Snake Tattoo) and Xanathar Guild thugs (Eye Tattoo), as well as four hidden Kenku who were totally not Kenku and were very unexpected that were left by the Xanathar Guild. After engaging in a gruesome fight, unfortunately killing Cernunn, the group ultimately prevailed, with a City Watch squadron lead by Captain Staget arriving to help clean up and preserve Cernunn's body. Ava, who went to the upstairs of the warehouse found a scared noble named Renaer Neverember, along with a locket of his late mother given to him by his estranged father. The locket was seemingly broken open to reveal a secret, but now empty compartment that Renaer himself was not even aware of. He believed both the Network and the Guild were after him, but in the chaos when the Xanathar Guild thugs raided the Zhents warehouse, his friend Floon was taken instead of him, and feeling guilty he was adamant that he helps the group, but Elroy managed to convince him to go home where he'd be safer, promising to keep him updated. After getting past the Watch's questions, with a bit of lucky bribery, the begrudged party figured their next destination was the sewers, and started heading towards it.`

        description: `The party ventured into the sewers beneath Waterdeep, following clues to find their kidnapped quarry, Floon Blagmaar. The dank, putrid tunnels twisted and turned, leading them deeper into the city's underbelly. As they navigated the treacherous passages, they encountered various denizens of the depths, including a group of Kuo-toa that worshipped a statue they called "Blibdoolpoolp."

        Their journey through the sewers was fraught with danger, but also yielded unexpected allies. They rescued a friendly flumph named Xolp, who provided them with crucial information about the Xanathar Guild's nearby base. The flumph's telepathic abilities and knowledge of the area proved invaluable as they pressed on.

        Finally, they reached the Xanathar Guild outpost, where they confronted the mind flayer Nihiloor and his intellect devourer. In a tense and harrowing battle, they managed to rescue Floon, who was on the brink of having his brain extracted. However, the victory came at a cost, as Nihiloor escaped, leaving behind a sense of unfinished business and lingering threat.

        With Floon rescued, the party made their way back to the surface, navigating through the labyrinthine sewers once more. They emerged into the streets of Waterdeep, battered but victorious, ready to return Floon to safety and collect their reward from Volo. The experience had bonded them as a team, but also left them with many questions about the larger conflicts brewing in the city of splendors.`
