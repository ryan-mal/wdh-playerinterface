Making their way downtown, walking fast, zooming under the effects of *Xoblob’s Modified Haste Tablet:tm:*, Laplace and Elroy escorted Xoblob to The Laughing Lass. Getting directed to a recently retired employee, with Xoblob getting a Business 101 lecture from the duo, they managed to convince Amara for the last item for Xoblob’s ritual. 
Arriving back at the shop, the two assisted the strange man in the ritual, creating **Robot Xoblob**, however, due to some error, accidently created a **Rogue Robot Xoblob**. After the novice adventures saved him once again, Xoblob kept his promise giving them the anti-poison vials, and the party offered to help him out again in the future if ever called upon. 

Meeting up with Jamie on The High Road, the trio made their way to Trollskull Alley where they met yet another foe – a barreling, out of control book trolley, that the **Three Urchins** decided to take a joyride on as a ‘prank’ at the expense of **Ayelet Moore**, an intern working for Rishaal the Page-turner. Teaching the kids a lesson and making acquaintances with Ayelet, the group attempted to get some well-deserved rest but were interrupted by a man claiming to be **Mark Genistar**, who was here to collect his lost wedding ring, found by Jamie. After the party refused to give it to him, he sicked his noble guards on them.

As battle ensured, they were assisted by a mysterious Giant Spider, who Jamie was familiar with. The new face, **Vernon** proved to be incredibly helpful in assisting the party evade the danger. After making acquaintances with each other, they learnt the truth of Mark Genistar. He was a charlatan trying to make some money who had recruited some noble guards who were recently fired by **House Adarbrent**. Alerting the city watch, including a young friend of Elroy’s, **Carrion Cromley**, the officers took away the criminals, leaving behind their stollen carriage and horse. Speaking with said horse, whom they named Sire, they learnt he was stolen from the Sea Maiden’s Faire. Buying him some fresh apples, and inviting him in, the party finally got their sleep.
