Making his way back from Ulkoria’s house, Jamie was hit by a Zhent who was thrown out of a door. The door in question was that of the noble villa **House Ilzimmer**. Overhearing something about Aasimar’s, Jamie immediately leapt into action and ran into the house. Vernon, who was tailing him, decided to follow. Inside, Jamie encountered a group of Zhents that brutally murdered the few remaining Noble Guards. Vernon instead saw the notorious **Black Viper**, who was currently filling her bag with expensive noble riches. Pulling the two aside, she made sure they weren’t with the Zhents before telling them of Lord Ilzimmer’s secret pedo-basement. She tasked them with finding a way down there while she held off some oncoming Zhent.

Making their way outside, followed by some more Zhents, Jamie, wanting to distract them, swallowed one of his newly acquired off-brand Beans:tm: which turned him into a Huge house-cat, distracting them, while Vernon burrowed a hole into a secret room with a hatch to the basement, and a scared Lord Ilzimmer surrendering to them. Further burrowing through the sealed hatch, with Jamie finishing off the Zhents outside, they found a staircase leading down. The Black Viper then entered and brutally maimed the Lord before jumping down to the basement, followed by the duo. 

Inside the basement, they found a hoard of riches, as well as 5 small, injured, Aasimar girls chained to the wall. Jamie, impulsively trying to free them, accidently opened a secret door which allowed a huge, murderous beast to enter the room. At the same time, some more Zhents entered the basement. The Black Viper took on the beast while the two freed the children and defeated the Zhents, and before they knew it, the beast was already defeated, and the Black Viper was already gone, along with all the riches – aside from the diamond that Jamie managed to get his hands on. Vernon took the children elsewhere while Jamie started heading home.
