Arriving from two different sides to the now-familiar sight of Trollskull Manor, Laplace and Jamie on one side, Vernon on the other, the rising sun glimmering on their skin, the two groups finally convened for the day after both having an early morning adventure. Elroy, who was running some errands was a bit late, but each group had something they wanted to talk about. Ergo, The Round Table Meeting. 

Pulling four chairs around the one working table, the four previously unacquainted individuals pilled all their valuables in the middle, and were asked to place all their cards on the table. Each going around, they explained their story in Waterdeep and all came to the realisation what exactly they were facing. Diving up the coin they had equally amongst each other, they agreed to work together for now, helping each other. Vernon, then receiving a note from the Emerald Enclave, requested to spar Jamie to test his capabilities, whilst Laplace had a quick visit to Mr. Vincent Trench. 
During this time, they were visited by a kind elven man named **J.B. Nevercott**, a haberdasher who wanted to thank them for helping out a friend of his. He offered them a discount on his clothes tailorships in exchange from them helping him and his business out every now and then. After the deal was made, two if his tailors were sent to take measurements â€“ one of which certainly had an interesting reaction to Marie.

Deciding to head down to The Market, the group did a lil shoppin before Vernon started leading them somewhere special in the Southern Ward.
