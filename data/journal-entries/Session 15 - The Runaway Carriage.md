The party's paths diverged once again as events unfolded across Waterdeep. **Laplace** and **Elroy**, fresh from their respective errands, responded to urgent knocking at Trollskull Manor. A drow named **Bouchaugious** sought refuge from **The True Knights of Waterdeep**â€”a narcissistic, fascist group hunting him. While Elroy successfully misdirected the pursuers, Laplace kept a constant, wary watch on their drow guest, his caution stemming from his past experiences. The situation took an intriguing turn when the True Knights, after threatening **Vincent Trench**, entered his business only to emerge mysteriously beaten and scarred.

Meanwhile, in the Sea Ward, Vernon and Jamie stumbled upon a Zhentarim raid of an innocuous-looking house on Phastal Street. Their pursuit of an escaping carriage led to an unexpected discovery: the building was actually a secret Asmodeus outpost. They managed to recover various items and information the Zhentarim had attempted to steal.
