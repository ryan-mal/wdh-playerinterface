As **Grum'Shar** met his second death, his final act was a spiteful one—using his remaining revenant power to bring down the Crypt around them. During the chaos of their escape with Grum'Shar's head and the unconscious **Carrion Cromley**, Jamie discovered a strange heart-shaped stone that drew him to keep it.

Racing against time, Elroy brought Cromley to the House of Inspired Hands, where a fairy named **Remi** and her Nimblewright called **Nim** successfully saved his life. In gratitude, Elroy pledged to spread word of Gond's church. Meanwhile, **Meloon Wardragon** secured both Cromley and the Intellect Devourer, before helping Vernon and Laplace resolve the Hawklight situation. He extended an invitation for the party to potentially join the Grey Hands to which they rejected.

**Elroy** and **Jamie**'s afternoon proved eventful: they revisited __The Ephemeral Emporium__ where Jamie purchased a dream of **Renaer**'s—before stopping at **Skeemo Weirdbottle**'s shop, __Weirdbottle Concotions__. After helping with a toppled carriage, they discovered its owner was **Lord Farris Margaster**, who rewarded them with Margaster watches. They later counselled a grieving **Bobby Newport**, helping him channel his anger over his brother's death by the Xanathar Guild into helping others affected by the gang war.

**Laplace** went shopping and turned the tables on would-be muggers before taking a well-earned shower. Vernon returned home to receive crucial news from **Vincent Trench**—his mother, publicly believed dead, was actually alive.

Amid these events, the party also dealt with the Turrie twins, **Torbie and Borreck**, who were fighting over a ring Jamie had previously found in the sewers. Each brother wanted this family heirloom to propose to **Mary McBeth**, though the party uncovered her scheme to pit the brothers against each other for their inheritance.
