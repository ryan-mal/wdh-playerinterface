Breaking through a sealed entrance to the crypt's deeper chambers, the party encountered an army of Intellect Devourers guarded by an Animated Armor serving **Elroy**'s ex-wife, **Nala Ahmaergo**. After defeating it and claiming its Sending Stone, they discovered the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild had taken control of the lower levels. Their exploration yielded several discoveries: Elroy gained a book of Rituals that marked him with the Xanathar's symbol, Jamie found a peculiar beholder-shaped lollipop, and they uncovered "Prototype 1 Crystal-Views"—surveillance devices allowing remote viewing throughout the Crypt.

While exploring the tombs of the seven heroes who defeated the original **Manshoon**, learning their histories and legacy, they ran into **Watchman Carrion Cromley**. Following his attempt to assist Jamie and Elroy, he had been attacked and possessed by an Intellect Devourer. The party managed to subdue him and recover his original brain.

Finally, they confronted the malevolent revenant responsible for recent events: **Grum'Shar**, seeking revenge against the party for his previous demise. His elaborate scheme involved manipulating **Krisga** into killing **Captain Otihand** and framing the party for the murder. After brutaly destroying him, they a recovered note that revealed the **Bregan D'aerthe** had supplied Grum'Shar with Crystal-View prototypes for testing, suggesting he make a pact with Mother **Mirthkettle**—the hag who once inhabited Trollskull Manor—to gain power for his revenge.
