Awaking on their third day in the Manor, Elroy and Vernon found themselves to be the only two in there, along with Sire. With some brief investigating, they decided to give Sire back to the Faire. As they returned, however, they were quickly alerted to the cries of **Squiddy** who was desperately trying to get help saving her friends **Nat** and **Jenks** - both trapped in a Dead House. Immediately rising to the occasion, Vernon and Elroy, who weren't even familiar with each other both raced into action.

Arriving at the __Dead House of Kelemvor__, they noticed it had been cordoned off by **Captain Staget** due to it suddenly infesting with aggressive plants with large vines and fungi continually expanding outward, threatening all surrounding buildings, and people closeby. The owner, **Rarder Cyne**, a Cleric of Kelemvor was desperately trying to get in to save his two trapped Acolytes, as well as the Urchins.

Making their way to the centre, they found the body of origin. Using clues, they visited the __Amethyst Hunters Guild Clubhouse__, an elite club formed by city nobles with a lot of spare time and not much respect for animal wildlife, who are hunting enthusiasts, competing socially for recognition and hunting trophies. Here, they met **Lord Arna Silverwood**, who eventually gave them the name and address of the body; **Thezuef Erneyn**, and helped them with another clue, directing them to a ship in __Mistshore__- the dilapidated North shore of Waterdeep's harbor. Visiting Thezuef’s house, they learnt of the spirit **Zielaph**, and some disturbing information. Heading to a ship in Mistshore – a place considered so dangerous the City Watch refused to send patrols into the area. Finding a Xanathar owned ship, dealing in illicit plants and drugs, including an addictive drug known as __Traveler's Dust__ as well as a reportedly dangerous plant taken from the __Darkvein__ Residence, known as the __Serpent’s Coil__. Having acquired the required materials for the ritual, the two managed to put an end to Zielaph’s Curse, freeing the cursed individuals as well as freeing Zielaph’s spirit itself. Leaving nothing but a small seed, the pair decided to grow it in a little pot plant. They then decided to head home, as the run started to rise.
