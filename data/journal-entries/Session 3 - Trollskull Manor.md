Having reconvened at Candle Lane, the group brought Floon back to the Yawning Portal where he met up again with Volo. As a reward for their work, Volo handed them ~~the 100gp they were promised~~ the deed to __Trollskull Manor__, an old tavern/mansion located in Trollskull Alley, North Ward and went off to sign the paperwork.
Having found an inscribed note meant for the sleeping goblin **Alvie**, Ava led the group to a stable house near the South Gate where they found a hideout occupied by the goblin they let free, **Alaine**, and her pet Gazer and savior (later named **Gazerath, and nicknamed Eyeballs**). Here they learned of a large complex owned by Xanathar, located in __Skullport__, a shadowy reflection of Waterdeep located deep in the Undermountain. Here, The Xanathar used young slaves from the Undermountain to operate one of their main crime facilities, including drugs, money laundering and trafficking, as well as keeping a group of Aasimars imprisoned. 
With Eyeballs joining them, and helping reveal a note to Ava, they made their way back to the sewers to hopefully located Alvie, however she was gone, as well as the bodies, with Eyeballs suggesting they took her back to Skullport. Here, Eyeballs warned for Ava to throw away any stolen items from The Old Xoblob Shop.

Splitting apart, with Eyeballs promising to contact them, the group found their way to **Renear Neverembers** house who was thankful to the party for saving Floon. As a reward, he handed them a ticket to the __Cassalanter Spring Masquerade Ball__, taking place 5 days from then (Ches 6th), with a mask and formalwear requirement, as well as a personal chauffeur. Hurrying off to his date, he offered any information he had before leaving the party with some handshakes. 
Finally making their way to Trollskull Alley, the group were introduced to The Three Urchins, claiming to be the **Trollskull Three**. **Nat, Squiddy and Jenks**, these brave warriors and strong adventures gave the party a tour of the alley, allowing them to meet a colorful cast of characters, before eventually setting up for the night in the dilapidated mess that was Trollskull Manor. Cleaning it up, Laplace got a sense of spiritual validation, while Jamie came across what seemed to be a haunted doll. Sleeping in interesting positions, the group finally awaited the next day.
