As Laplace and Vernon reached the entrance to the __Crypt of the Seven__, a portal from the Ethereal Plane suddenly ejected Elroy and Jamie, causing all four to collide. After exchanging tales of their separate morning adventures, they encountered **Sir Ambrose Everdawn**—an elderly, eccentric guard of the Crypt accompanied by his yellow faerie dragon companion. Age had left him unable to maintain his duties, and vicious creatures had locked him out of the mausoleum he once protected.

The party ventured into the Crypt—a dark shaft with manipulated gravity, dedicated to the seven Waterdhavian heroes who slayed the original **Manshoon**. As they navigated through various puzzles and chambers, they confronted two undead twins whose defeated souls manifested as a mysterious weapon. When Elroy first grasped it, the weapon took the form of a pen, though unknown to all, it carried a curse of vengeance.

During their exploration of the crypt, **Marie** was killed amid the numerous battles and challenges they faced. Vernon taught Laplace how to resummon her soul—a process that revealed glimpses of Laplace's emerging shadow magic abilities.
