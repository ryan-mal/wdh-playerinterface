Following the theatre confrontation, **Gazerath** arrived to witness **Vernon**'s unnecessarily brutal dispatch of the remaining assassins. Concerned, he offered to help Vernon channel his magic through his mother's love rather than his father's rage, agreeing to temporarily join the party in the process.

Their journey home led them to a mysterious tent—__the Sapphire Centre__—run by a large Holyphant named **Zozo**. This exclusive slavery ring, they discovered, counted both the Margaster and Rosznar families among its clientele. Vernon, guided by Zozo's judgment, purchased a Flumph named **Barry** (with the intention of freeing him), whose tragic past included the deaths of his siblings in captivity.

The long day finally drew to a close at Trollskull Manor, where they encountered the **Three Urchins** playing ball. The party extended their hospitality to both their new companions—Gazerath and Barry—and the children, offering cookies and shelter for the night.
