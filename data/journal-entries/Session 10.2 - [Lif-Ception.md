**Jamie** and **Elroy** awoke to the bustling sounds of a crowded tavern. They found themselves in a pristine version of Trollskull Manor, where their ghostly bartender **Lif** was alive and serving customers—they had been transported into his memories from over a century ago. In this dreamscape, they encountered **Richard Stone**, a private investigator who seemed to be a predecessor to **Vincent Trench**.

The truth slowly emerged: Lif had sensed a malevolent spirit approaching the manor and, in an attempt to protect all four companions, only managed to transport Jamie and Elroy to safety within his memories. Memory-Lif, unaware of anything beyond his own death, needed convincing of their connection to his future self. As they helped him recover these memories, they fell deeper into a strange amalgamation of dreams, where Jamie's unusual mindscape began bleeding into Lif's memories, manifesting visions of his childhood home and his caretaker, **Divona**.

As hostile spirits began invading the dream, causing it to collapse, Jamie and Elroy escaped into __The Ephemeral Emporium__—a mysterious ethereal shop dealing in secrets, dreams and memories, run by an elven man named **Liland**. This enigmatic establishment, only accessible by invitation, appeared randomly throughout the Ethereal Plane. While there, they witnessed Esvele Rosznar purchasing someone's dreams before departing, though she remained unaware of their presence. Gaining an invitation into the Emporium, they group bought some dreams and left to the Ethereal Plane. 

Trapped in the Ethereal Plane, the duo used Jamie's Box of Lingering Spirits to contact **Watchman Carrion Cromley** in the Material Plane, requesting his help to find them. Making their way back to the ethereal version of Trollskull Manor, they reunited with Lif, who helped summon the soul of his old friend, the wizard **Elban Fizzer**. While defending Fizzer from attacking spirits, he cast a spell to transport them to the place where the malevolent revenant's energy was strongest—the Crypt of the Seven.
