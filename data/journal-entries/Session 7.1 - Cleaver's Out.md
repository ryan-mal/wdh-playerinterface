Awaking on their third day in the Manor, Jamie and Laplace found themselves the only two awake. Venturing into the basement, they found Lif's hidden stash of expensive Amnian Wine. After a brief encounter with Lif himself, allowing them to learn that this was the last thing he did before his disappearance, the duo set off to sell Lif's last few bottles.
After a brief interaction with Emmek Frewn, they decided to meet with PI, **Mr. Vincent Trench**. He offered to tell them everything he knew about Lif if they helped with a simple Missing Person’s case of a lost little girl. Agreeing to it, they instead headed straight to The Yawning Portal. Selling the rest of their wine to Durnan for an exorbitant price, and making a strong impression on his cat, before finally following up on their lead.

Making their way to the girl’s house in the __Field Ward__, they met **Agatha Elron**, who along with her husband **Michael** hadn’t seen their daughter **Ella** since the night prior. Mentioning she occasionally hung out at the __Half Barrel Tavern__, a few streets over, they decided to investigate there. Swiftly arriving, they met the owner, **Leanna Wright**, who was trying to get her hungover patrons (including **Miles**) to leave so she could close down. When asked about Ella, she mentioned that she usually saw her hanging around with **Biv the Butcher**. She didn’t quite like Ella as she was loud and always distracted Biv, but mentioned Biv was also missing and it was quite unlike him to miss his shift the night prior at the tavern. Miles mentioned that Biv was weird and creepy and didn’t have a very good reputation.

Making their way to Biv’s slum, a few blocks over, near a recently burnt-down house, they started searching the area. Using his new wand, Jamie uncovered Biv’s private Journal, whilst Laplace managed to find a potion and a key to the City of the Dead (COTD). Using the information they found, they traced Biv to the COTD. On their way, they had a run-in with a strange, but impressive mechanical creation with 8 halos that was running errands for its master. Continuing on, they managed to get into the COTD, where, after a bit of searching they found Ella, hiding atop a tree branch, with an injured leg, with a couple of Spined Devils dead on the floor beneath her. Two, however, were still alive, and were wandering around looking for her. At the base of the tree, propped up against the trunk was the body of a large, burly elderly man, covered in blood. Biv. 

The duo decided to engage with the Devils that were strangely populating the COTD, and after successfully slaying them saved Ella. She told them what happened: She broke her leg jumping a log and Biv decided she was safer with him than alone. He took her with him to the COTD, telling stories on the way, offering his staff as a crutch. But, after a while at Biv’s grandmother’s grave, Biv realized something was not right. Seeing movement out the corner of his eye he turned to see a horde of Spined Devils break off from a group of cultists in the distance and heading towards him and Ella. With nothing but a knife on him, and an injured child to care for, he quickly rushed her towards a tree and hoisted her up into its limbs. It was only as she reached the branch that he felt the first shot of pain sear though his shoulder. Swinging round he fought the devils back, giving Ella time to climb high into the branches. It was as she found safety that he succumbed to his wounds, dying at the base of the tree.

Having managed to save the girl, they contacted two City Watch Officers, **Charles** and **Xavier**, who took Biv’s body to a nearby Dead House, and report the Devil bodies. Taking Ella back to her family, and joining them for breakfast, they then delivered the news to Leanna – who didn’t take it all to well. With an intense start to the morning, it was just about sunrise and the crew made their way back to Trollskull Manor.
