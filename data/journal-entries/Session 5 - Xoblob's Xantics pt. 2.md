Continuing their Scavenger Hunt, next on their list: a rare bottle of Luskan Stout, the group were pointed to the huge event in the Dock Ward, the __Sea Maidenâ€™s Faire__. A travelling carnival from Luskan that is making their way down the Sword Coast, currently stopped at Waterdeep. The Faire performs shows and parades all around the Dock Ward and have circuses, exotic animals and food, amazing performances and stunts and a fancy Luskan casino; the pride of the festival being the two anchored ships the __Heartbreaker__ and __Hellraiser__, and a third ship, the __ Eyecatcher__ being anchored a bit away from the pier.
After sitting through a Great Show, Laplace, Jamie and Elroy were introduced to the fabulous **Captain Zardoz Zord**, the leader and ringmaster of the Faire. After making acquaintance with each other, Zord growing to like them, he offered them the fancy Stout at a discount, provided they gather attention towards the Sea Maidens Faire.

Making their way out of the Dock Ward, Jamie split off from the party and ended up going to visit Volo in the Sea Ward. There he was directed to **Ulkoria Stonemarrow**, a previous resident of Trollskull Manor, who gave him an insight to the history of the estate. Laplace and Elroy attempted to get one of the last required components, taking them to __The Laughing Lass__, where they failed to get the required item.
Gathering all the other items, they met Xoblob back at his store, saying they couldnt get one last item. Xoblob then declared they were to escort and guard him until he procured it, and completed his ritual. Embarking on their journey, however, Xoblob was attacked by two Xanathar thugs, who, after engaging in a brutal fight, were eventually taken down by the old man and young lad. 
They then started making their way down to The Laughing Lass as Jamie started leaving Ulkoria's house.
