While Elroy rested and Laplace went book shopping, **Jamie** and Vernon **decided** to return the belongings Laplace had taken from some would-be muggers. Their journey to the Field Ward took them through a large protest against the potential return of the **Rosznar family**, who had been banished from Waterdeep a decade ago over slavery accusations.

At their destination, they found one of the muggers badly wounded and caring for his terminally ill daughter. Vernon, moved by their situation, used his healing abilities to cure both father and daughter, earning their profound gratitude.
