Departing from the busy market, Vernon guided the contrived party of misfits to a two-story manor lavishly decorated with pillars and enclosed within high, fancy walls; __Phaulkonmere__. A Phaulkon family member was surprised to see the party at her doorstep. While leaving, the party ran into a groundskeeper, **Melannor**, who guided the party to a tree. Next thing they knew, they were in a wooden room with tables and chairs – however every single thing was made from the same wooden source, almost as if the entire room was grown inside a tree. 

They then met **Aina Lefaliir**, an archdruid elf and a the leader of the Emerald Enclave. After apologising for gathering intel on the party prior – due to the spies enthralled in the city from both the Guild and Zhents causing the inability to trust anyone, she then explained why they were invited: The Enclave sought to destroy the vile corruption growing within the city, as well as destroy the devils and the Cult of Asmodeus. She also offered to sponsor their trip to Skullport and offer additional information if they decided to join. 

With Laplace and Jamie against, Elroy agreed to work with them whilst Vernon became an official member. Elroy and Vernon were taken in to meet an entity who used to be known as **Jeryth Phaulkon**. A demi-god, who, when died, was chosen by a great deity to lead of the Enclave. The disembodied voice thanked them for their willingness to work with them, and bestowed upon them a *Charm of Restoration*, also offering a safe haven to members. Re-entering the meeting room, **Eyeballs and Alaine** were also there, working with the Enclave to free their friends and family.

Leaving, the crew headed to Xoblob’s where Laplace offered him a present whilst Vernon was formally introduced to him. On their way out they were interrupted by a speeding City Watch carriage that swerved to a stop right in front of them. Two fancy dressed men, one short, the other tall disembarked and introduced themselves:

**Detective Barnibus Blastwind** of the Watchful Order and **Detective Saeth Cromley** of the City Watch. They questioned Jamie as they had a witness report of a “small bandaged boy” in the area around the time of Lord Ilzimmer’s death. After thorough questioning, they let him go, telling him not the leave town.

Elroy, with the help of Laplace decided to head to __Mother Tamra’s House of Pleasure and Healing__ to check up on **Sabbit** who had been quite injured by the Guild. On their way, through the bustling streets, Elroy noticed he’d been pick-pocketed; and the Black Vipers calling card sitting in his pocket. Whilst at the fancy building which served as a healing and rest centre, with clerics, spas and a fancy mechanical robot with 8-halos for a head working as a housecleaner, Elroy found his old friend bedridden from injuries. After having a little talk, and some angry poor injured people nagging him, he offered them his remaining coins before leaving.
On the other hand, Jamie and Vernon headed to the __Waterdeep Wazoo__ to talk to **R.R.Rudderson** on information they obtained. Getting his payment, Jamie got a *Capture*, a magic item that allows him to capture a moment in time and get photos of the Shard Shunners.

Heading to the City of the Dead, where they agreed to meetup, Jamie and Laplace found a groundkeeper who guided them to Lif and Marie Adarbrents graves. On his way out, Laplace had a quick run-in with Maries teacher who was teaching Marie to help others, and was now trying to do so herself. As they get back, they notice a very distressed Griffon with a City Guard riding towards them. Crashlanding in front of Vernon and Elroy, Vernon managed to calm down the very distressed beast while the Griffon Rider ran off to the toilet. 
On their way home, Jamie & Laplace made a quick stop at the Swordmaiden, where they found a Halfing written note left by the Shunners. Joining the crew back at the manor for a good sleep.
