Down in the revolting sewers under __Candle Lane__, with Laplace and Ava getting some brown-stained spots on their clothing and bags, the 3 adventures made their way through. Noticing a faded symbol of a yellow-eye hidden on the roof, they found their way through the tunnels where they came face to face with a **Gazer** guarding a T-junction. After getting swiftly beaten up by Laplace, the small group was than approached by a figure who was still drenched in shadows. Getting attacked by Ava as soon as he got close, it was revealed to be a kid named **Jamie**, covered in spectral vine-like bandages. After establishing he was a childhood friend of Cernunn, he decided to aid the party, taking over for Cernunn’s mission in Waterdeep. 

The group eventually made it to a Xanathar Guild hideout in the sewers, where they snuck past a sleeping goblin, stealing his money, and shortly thereafter finding a locket depicting a broken goblin relationship beneath some bedrolls. After crawling a bit more, they found a **Xanatharian Duergar & Human** attempting to barricade a small room. Swiftly ending them, with Ava burning their bodies, the party decided to figure out what the two thugs were trying to barricade. Entering the room, they see a very messy and unkept lavatory with a **Grey Ooze** slithering out of the drop toilet, attacking Laplace on sight. However, the party put an end to that quite easily too. 

Making their way down to the main rooms for the hideout, they overheard an interrogation between a half-orc referred to as **Grum’shar**, who, clearly trying to impress an onlooker with different torture techniques, was sure that he “got the right guy, Renaer Neverember” and wouldn’t give up until the victim gave them __“the Eye”__. Ava and Elroy managed to interrupt the half-orc and draw him outside where he was lured into a string of traps laid out by Ava, and was swiftly knocked down by Laplace.

In the room they found **Floon Blagmaar** tied up and tortured, behind him was a **Mind Flayer**, holding an **Intellect Devourer**, like a maniacal super villain with a cat. The Mind Flayer promptly dropped the Intellect Devourer and ran into a room unseen to the party, holding a spherical stone object, only moments later a glowing white light was seen emanating from that very room. While Ava went to free Floon, Laplace engaged in combat with the Intellect Devourer, and was soon skewered by Ava’s shortsword, providing an impromptu shower for the Halfling. Upon investigating the room where the Mind Flayer fled to, they were met in an otherwise empty room, aside from an imposing stone pillar, within it was carved a small symbol - a perfect circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference - In the middle of this circle was a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye. Further inspection revealed that it had a faint and fading magical aura, and that one could place a spherical key. There was no Mind Flayer in sight.

Elroy explored the surrounding rooms, freeing a heartbroken goblin in the process, and conveyed to the party that there were two potential exits. The party agreed to meet back at Candle Lane, splitting in two. Ava, Laplace and a weakened Floon exited through a bar full of curious halflings that got very personal with Ava. Elroy and Jamie met a suspecting Tiefling who begrudgingly let them through. The five met back up at Candle Lane to discuss their next course of action.
