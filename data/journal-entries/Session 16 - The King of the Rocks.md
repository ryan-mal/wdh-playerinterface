The party, dressed in their finest suits, made their way to the __Lightsinger Theatre__, stopping first at the **Old Xoblob Shop** where Vernon acquired Xoblob's Xenium Amulet to strengthen his connection with **Gazerath**. At the theatre, they attended the first act of "The King of the Rocks" before meeting with the Harpers during intermission in **Mirt**'s private booth.

There, they were introduced to Mirt's right hands: **Rose**, head of magic, and **Piper**, head of martials. While discussing potential Harper membership, Piper's initial hostility toward Laplace due to his past crimes set a tense atmosphere. The meeting culminated in both Elroy and Vernon joining the organization.

When a Harper agent warned of an impending assassination attempt, Mirt quietly evacuated the theatre and enlisted the party's help. The __Bregan D'aerthe__ launched their attack using new technology—Smoke Powder—and strange projectile weapons. During the confrontation, Laplace made his first intentional kill, causing him to break down. In a pivotal moment, Piper, despite their previous antagonism, helped him regain composure, challenging him to prove himself better through actions rather than remorse.
