**Laplace** and **Vernon** awoke to find themselves surrounded by **Meloon Wardragon** and the **Grey Hands**, with **Jamie** and **Elroy** nowhere to be seen. They learned that **Captain Otihand**, leader of Waterdeep's Griffon Riders, had been murderedâ€”and they were the prime suspects, being the last people seen at the crime scene. Though they proclaimed their innocence, they were given a chance to prove it by finding the real culprit within a set timeframe.

At the City of the Dead, the scene of the crime, they met **Nerisys Mistletoe**, who had discovered her friend's body. Their investigation yielded two potential suspects: **Lilly Nailo**, an out-of-town adventurer who had crossed paths with the Captain, and **Lieutenant Oswald Nygma**, his jealous second-in-command. During the encounter, they were strangly attacked by ghosts in the cemetery - which they managed to defeat. They then tracked down Lilly at the Yawning Portal, learning her Griffon had been impounded by the Griffon Cavalry.

Their pursuit then led them to Oswald Nygma's heavily fortified residence. After failing his worthiness test to enter, they managed to convince him to lower his defences for a conversation. Following a lead from both Lily and Oswald, they investigated the Hawklight estate, where Laplace attempted to speak with **Krisga Hawklight** alone while Vernon rested. The meeting was interrupted by her imposing father, **Lord Fluffy Hawklight**.

Seeking help, Laplace visited Brandarth Hall to consult **Renaer**, who though occupied, gifted him a wooden Emerald Enclave flask. Reuniting with Vernon, they returned to the Hawklight villa, where they uncovered a tragic truth: Krisga, who had been in a secret relationship with Captain Otihand, had been manipulated into murdering him by a malevolent spirit. After a violent confrontation that ended with Lord Hawklight's death, they left Krisga in the care of her maid **Suzie**, and set back to the City of the Dead to investigate where Krisga had encountered her mysterious manipulator - The Crypt of the Seven.
