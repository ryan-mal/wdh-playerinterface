Awakening on their first day at Trollskull Manor, with each person having their own personal interactions in the house, the group were met by a peculiar man; a large burley Goliath man, donning glasses much too small for his face and a fancy suit. Claiming to be **Bank Borker**, Volo’s personal accountant, he did a quick inspection of the Manor before explaining the costs needed by the party in order to make it liveable again, and for possibly opening it as a tavern for passive income.

Their interactions were kept short, however, when Ava, Laplace, Elroy and Marie started getting increasingly sick due to the effects of *Xoblob’s anti-theft-poison*. Deciding to visit him, requesting *Xoblob’s anti-anti-theft-poison*, Xoblob gave some of them the cure, but made them swallow a strange pill, telling them they better follow his instructions or face a fate worse than death. He then handed them a list of interesting items he required them to fetch and had them on their way. Ava, however, decided to peruse some Zhent thugs who were leaving Xoblobs shop. After stalking them for the entire day as they had a private meeting at The Skewered Dragon, she followed the four of them out, where she decided to try attack them, but was promptly subdued and captured.

The rest of the party, however, after meeting back up to discuss plans, decided to start on their Scavenger Hunt by heading into the Sewers for a Gazer’s eye. Spending hours there, they met a peculiar woman, later named **Shroom Lady**. This crazy old woman, wearing a large mushroom as a hat was wondering through the sewers looking for her Shrooms after she lost them all. As the party continued on, they met some interesting faces down there, including a pair of Drow men carrying a large barrel through the tunnels. They came across a few Gazers, promptly defeating them, with Laplace skewering them on his Pool Cue. Finding a few Shrooms along the way, they eventually met up with the Shroom Lady – currently captured by a few Xanatharian thugs, awaiting the party. After engaging in a tiring battle, and feeding a Shroom to the Shroom Lady, gaining her aid in the fight, the thugs were defeated, with the Shroom Lady handing a party a reward before dispersing into the sewers. 

Back at the Manor for a must needed sleep, the group had more interactions with the strange forces of Trollskull Manor. Laplace encountered a small and angry human, **Emmek Frewn**, who was attempting to scare the party out of Trollskull Manor to claim it for himself, before getting kicked out. Elroy managed to gain some insight into the spectral elf Lif and his desires while Jamie had a vision that led him and the party to the basement. There they found a statue of children emerging from a wall, with one of their faces, and one of their hands missing.

`DAY 3 - Ches 3rd`
The next day, deciding the continue on their Scavenger Hunt, the group decided to split up. Elroy headed to the Yawning Portal to talk to Durnan and acquire some interesting items. Laplace headed to The House of Song where he met an old friend of Elroy’s, **Sabbit**, and had a run in with the tougher aspects of living in Waterdeep. Jamie headed to one of the famed Walking Statues, the Swordmaiden, where he met a gang of halfings hanging out, who referred to themselves as the “Shunners”. After learning some rich history, Jamie got his item. After all finishing at their respective places, they all made their own way down to the Dock Ward to attend the Sea Maiden’s Faire.
