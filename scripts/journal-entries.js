    "description": "After all individually making their own way to table 23 of __The Yawning Portal__ – with the exception of Laplace, who sat at the next table over, 4 seemingly mismatched individuals finally got a chance to meet. **Ava**, **Elroy**, **Cernunn**, **Laplace** and his cute pink snake **Marie**.\n\nWhile awkwardly sitting together at the same boot, the tavern started getting loud and rowdy as an experienced party of adventurers started making their way down the large portal. Everyone around started making bets before eventually dying down. However, one group didn’t settle down as much. A group of thugs, with __black eye-shaped tattoos__ on their bodies picked a fight with a half-orc later identified as **Yagra Strongfist**. She managed to take 3 of the thugs out before getting knocked out by the fourth one. As the final thug started celebrating his victory, a *Troll*, with an entire flurry of *Stirges* leapt out of the portal and ripped him in half. The barkeep, **Durnan**, immediately leapt into action with his magical great sword to fight the Troll. While doing so, however, 3 Striges detached from the Troll and noticed Ava, who was trying to drag Yagra's unconscious body away. After an epic battle, the threat was subdued, and the patrons went right back to drinking. Durnan offered the individuals a free drink which Curnunn gladly took, and used the opportunity to learn about a symbol from his past.\n\nEventually, their contact **Volo** arrived, who had a request of them. He was worried about his friend **Floon Blagmaar**, who had gone missing two days prior, and Volo was concerned something had happened as a result of the escalated gang violence in Waterdeep as of late. After promising them 100gp each, with 10gp up front… and a handful of signed autographs, the newly formed group took to their first clue; a shady tavern known as __The Skewered Dragon__ in the Dock Ward - a sketchy part of Waterdeep. On the way there they saw the aftermath of a crime scene with many bloody bodies of people with eye tattoos and people with snake tattoos. After gaining information at the Skewered Dragon, they made their way to __The Old Xoblob Shop__, where they met **Xoblob**, a Deep Gnome obsessed with two things: Xanathar and Purple. He even had a large purple plushy of a beholder in his shopfront. While Ava snuck in the back and stole a purple candelabra with three purple candles, Elroy and Cernunn learnt some information that led them to a warehouse in __Candle Lane__. Apparently after Volo left Floon, he was joined by another, similar looking man, and both were attacked and kidnapped by snake tattooed men. \n\nAfter all 4 made it to the warehouse, marked by a Flying Snake with an arrow through its head, the group made quite a bit of a ruckus before getting inside. When they finally did, they were greeted to many dead bodies identified to be `Black Network agents` (Zhents/Snake Tattoo) and `Xanathar Guild thugs` (Eye Tattoo), as well as four hidden Kenku who were totally not Kenku and were very unexpected that were left by the Xanathar Guild. After engaging in a gruesome fight, unfortunately killing Cernunn, the group ultimately prevailed, with a City Watch squadron lead by **Captain Staget** arriving to help clean up and preserve Cernunn’s body. Ava, who went to the upstairs of the warehouse found a scared noble named **Renaer Neverember**, along with a locket of his late mother given to him by his estranged father. The locket was seemingly broken open to reveal a secret, but now empty compartment that Renaer himself was not even aware of. He believed both the Network and the Guild were after him, but in the chaos when the Xanathar Guild thugs raided the Zhents warehouse, his friend Floon was taken instead of him, and feeling guilty he was adamant that he helps the group, but Elroy managed to convince him to go home where he’d be safer, promising to keep him updated. After getting past the Watch’s questions, with a bit of lucky bribery, the begrudged party figured their next destination was the sewers, and started heading towards it.",

    "description": "Down in the revolting sewers under __Candle Lane__, with Laplace and Ava getting some brown-stained spots on their clothing and bags, the 3 adventures made their way through. Noticing a faded symbol of a yellow-eye hidden on the roof, they found their way through the tunnels where they came face to face with a **Gazer** guarding a T-junction. After getting swiftly beaten up by Laplace, the small group was than approached by a figure who was still drenched in shadows. Getting attacked by Ava as soon as he got close, it was revealed to be a kid named **Jamie**, covered in spectral vine-like bandages. After establishing he was a childhood friend of Cernunn, he decided to aid the party, taking over for Cernunn’s mission in Waterdeep. \n\nThe group eventually made it to a Xanathar Guild hideout in the sewers, where they snuck past a sleeping goblin, stealing his money, and shortly thereafter finding a locket depicting a broken goblin relationship beneath some bedrolls. After crawling a bit more, they found a **Xanatharian Duergar & Human** attempting to barricade a small room. Swiftly ending them, with Ava burning their bodies, the party decided to figure out what the two thugs were trying to barricade. Entering the room, they see a very messy and unkept lavatory with a **Grey Ooze** slithering out of the drop toilet, attacking Laplace on sight. However, the party put an end to that quite easily too. \n\nMaking their way down to the main rooms for the hideout, they overheard an interrogation between a half-orc referred to as **Grum’shar**, who, clearly trying to impress an onlooker with different torture techniques, was sure that he “got the right guy, Renaer Neverember” and wouldn’t give up until the victim gave them __“the Eye”__. Ava and Elroy managed to interrupt the half-orc and draw him outside where he was lured into a string of traps laid out by Ava, and was swiftly knocked down by Laplace.\n\nIn the room they found **Floon Blagmaar** tied up and tortured, behind him was a **Mind Flayer**, holding an **Intellect Devourer**, like a maniacal super villain with a cat. The Mind Flayer promptly dropped the Intellect Devourer and ran into a room unseen to the party, holding a spherical stone object, only moments later a glowing white light was seen emanating from that very room. While Ava went to free Floon, Laplace engaged in combat with the Intellect Devourer, and was soon skewered by Ava’s shortsword, providing an impromptu shower for the Halfling. Upon investigating the room where the Mind Flayer fled to, they were met in an otherwise empty room, aside from an imposing stone pillar, within it was carved a small symbol - a perfect circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference - In the middle of this circle was a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye. Further inspection revealed that it had a faint and fading magical aura, and that one could place a spherical key. There was no Mind Flayer in sight.\n\nElroy explored the surrounding rooms, freeing a heartbroken goblin in the process, and conveyed to the party that there were two potential exits. The party agreed to meet back at Candle Lane, splitting in two. Ava, Laplace and a weakened Floon exited through a bar full of curious halflings that got very personal with Ava. Elroy and Jamie met a suspecting Tiefling who begrudgingly let them through. The five met back up at Candle Lane to discuss their next course of action.",

    "description": "Having reconvened at Candle Lane, the group brought Floon back to the Yawning Portal where he met up again with Volo. As a reward for their work, Volo handed them ~~the 100gp they were promised~~ the deed to __Trollskull Manor__, an old tavern/mansion located in Trollskull Alley, North Ward and went off to sign the paperwork.\nHaving found an inscribed note meant for the sleeping goblin **Alvie**, Ava led the group to a stable house near the South Gate where they found a hideout occupied by the goblin they let free, **Alaine**, and her pet Gazer and savior (later named **Gazerath, and nicknamed Eyeballs**). Here they learned of a large complex owned by Xanathar, located in __Skullport__, a shadowy reflection of Waterdeep located deep in the Undermountain. Here, The Xanathar used young slaves from the Undermountain to operate one of their main crime facilities, including drugs, money laundering and trafficking, as well as keeping a group of Aasimars imprisoned. \nWith Eyeballs joining them, and helping reveal a note to Ava, they made their way back to the sewers to hopefully located Alvie, however she was gone, as well as the bodies, with Eyeballs suggesting they took her back to Skullport. Here, Eyeballs warned for Ava to throw away any stolen items from The Old Xoblob Shop.\n\nSplitting apart, with Eyeballs promising to contact them, the group found their way to **Renear Neverembers** house who was thankful to the party for saving Floon. As a reward, he handed them a ticket to the __Cassalanter Spring Masquerade Ball__, taking place 5 days from then (Ches 6th), with a mask and formalwear requirement, as well as a personal chauffeur. Hurrying off to his date, he offered any information he had before leaving the party with some handshakes. \nFinally making their way to Trollskull Alley, the group were introduced to The Three Urchins, claiming to be the **Trollskull Three**. **Nat, Squiddy and Jenks**, these brave warriors and strong adventures gave the party a tour of the alley, allowing them to meet a colorful cast of characters, before eventually setting up for the night in the dilapidated mess that was Trollskull Manor. Cleaning it up, Laplace got a sense of spiritual validation, while Jamie came across what seemed to be a haunted doll. Sleeping in interesting positions, the group finally awaited the next day.",

    "description": "Awakening on their first day at Trollskull Manor, with each person having their own personal interactions in the house, the group were met by a peculiar man; a large burley Goliath man, donning glasses much too small for his face and a fancy suit. Claiming to be **Bank Borker**, Volo’s personal accountant, he did a quick inspection of the Manor before explaining the costs needed by the party in order to make it liveable again, and for possibly opening it as a tavern for passive income.\n\nTheir interactions were kept short, however, when Ava, Laplace, Elroy and Marie started getting increasingly sick due to the effects of *Xoblob’s anti-theft-poison*. Deciding to visit him, requesting *Xoblob’s anti-anti-theft-poison*, Xoblob gave some of them the cure, but made them swallow a strange pill, telling them they better follow his instructions or face a fate worse than death. He then handed them a list of interesting items he required them to fetch and had them on their way. Ava, however, decided to peruse some Zhent thugs who were leaving Xoblobs shop. After stalking them for the entire day as they had a private meeting at The Skewered Dragon, she followed the four of them out, where she decided to try attack them, but was promptly subdued and captured.\n\nThe rest of the party, however, after meeting back up to discuss plans, decided to start on their Scavenger Hunt by heading into the Sewers for a Gazer’s eye. Spending hours there, they met a peculiar woman, later named **Shroom Lady**. This crazy old woman, wearing a large mushroom as a hat was wondering through the sewers looking for her Shrooms after she lost them all. As the party continued on, they met some interesting faces down there, including a pair of Drow men carrying a large barrel through the tunnels. They came across a few Gazers, promptly defeating them, with Laplace skewering them on his Pool Cue. Finding a few Shrooms along the way, they eventually met up with the Shroom Lady – currently captured by a few Xanatharian thugs, awaiting the party. After engaging in a tiring battle, and feeding a Shroom to the Shroom Lady, gaining her aid in the fight, the thugs were defeated, with the Shroom Lady handing a party a reward before dispersing into the sewers. \n\nBack at the Manor for a must needed sleep, the group had more interactions with the strange forces of Trollskull Manor. Laplace encountered a small and angry human, **Emmek Frewn**, who was attempting to scare the party out of Trollskull Manor to claim it for himself, before getting kicked out. Elroy managed to gain some insight into the spectral elf Lif and his desires while Jamie had a vision that led him and the party to the basement. There they found a statue of children emerging from a wall, with one of their faces, and one of their hands missing.\n\n`DAY 3 - Ches 3rd`\nThe next day, deciding the continue on their Scavenger Hunt, the group decided to split up. Elroy headed to the Yawning Portal to talk to Durnan and acquire some interesting items. Laplace headed to The House of Song where he met an old friend of Elroy’s, **Sabbit**, and had a run in with the tougher aspects of living in Waterdeep. Jamie headed to one of the famed Walking Statues, the Swordmaiden, where he met a gang of halfings hanging out, who referred to themselves as the “Shunners”. After learning some rich history, Jamie got his item. After all finishing at their respective places, they all made their own way down to the Dock Ward to attend the Sea Maiden’s Faire.",

    "description": "Continuing their Scavenger Hunt, next on their list: a rare bottle of Luskan Stout, the group were pointed to the huge event in the Dock Ward, the __Sea Maiden’s Faire__. A travelling carnival from Luskan that is making their way down the Sword Coast, currently stopped at Waterdeep. The Faire performs shows and parades all around the Dock Ward and have circuses, exotic animals and food, amazing performances and stunts and a fancy Luskan casino; the pride of the festival being the two anchored ships the __Heartbreaker__ and __Hellraiser__, and a third ship, the __ Eyecatcher__ being anchored a bit away from the pier.\nAfter sitting through a Great Show, Laplace, Jamie and Elroy were introduced to the fabulous **Captain Zardoz Zord**, the leader and ringmaster of the Faire. After making acquaintance with each other, Zord growing to like them, he offered them the fancy Stout at a discount, provided they gather attention towards the Sea Maidens Faire.\n\nMaking their way out of the Dock Ward, Jamie split off from the party and ended up going to visit Volo in the Sea Ward. There he was directed to **Ulkoria Stonemarrow**, a previous resident of Trollskull Manor, who gave him an insight to the history of the estate. Laplace and Elroy attempted to get one of the last required components, taking them to __The Laughing Lass__, where they failed to get the required item.\nGathering all the other items, they met Xoblob back at his store, saying they couldnt get one last item. Xoblob then declared they were to escort and guard him until he procured it, and completed his ritual. Embarking on their journey, however, Xoblob was attacked by two Xanathar thugs, who, after engaging in a brutal fight, were eventually taken down by the old man and young lad. \nThey then started making their way down to The Laughing Lass as Jamie started leaving Ulkoria's house.",

    "description": "Making his way back from Ulkoria’s house, Jamie was hit by a Zhent who was thrown out of a door. The door in question was that of the noble villa **House Ilzimmer**. Overhearing something about Aasimar’s, Jamie immediately leapt into action and ran into the house. Vernon, who was tailing him, decided to follow. Inside, Jamie encountered a group of Zhents that brutally murdered the few remaining Noble Guards. Vernon instead saw the notorious **Black Viper**, who was currently filling her bag with expensive noble riches. Pulling the two aside, she made sure they weren’t with the Zhents before telling them of Lord Ilzimmer’s secret pedo-basement. She tasked them with finding a way down there while she held off some oncoming Zhent.\n\nMaking their way outside, followed by some more Zhents, Jamie, wanting to distract them, swallowed one of his newly acquired off-brand Beans:tm: which turned him into a Huge house-cat, distracting them, while Vernon burrowed a hole into a secret room with a hatch to the basement, and a scared Lord Ilzimmer surrendering to them. Further burrowing through the sealed hatch, with Jamie finishing off the Zhents outside, they found a staircase leading down. The Black Viper then entered and brutally maimed the Lord before jumping down to the basement, followed by the duo. \n\nInside the basement, they found a hoard of riches, as well as 5 small, injured, Aasimar girls chained to the wall. Jamie, impulsively trying to free them, accidently opened a secret door which allowed a huge, murderous beast to enter the room. At the same time, some more Zhents entered the basement. The Black Viper took on the beast while the two freed the children and defeated the Zhents, and before they knew it, the beast was already defeated, and the Black Viper was already gone, along with all the riches – aside from the diamond that Jamie managed to get his hands on. Vernon took the children elsewhere while Jamie started heading home.",

    "description": "Making their way downtown, walking fast, zooming under the effects of *Xoblob’s Modified Haste Tablet:tm:*, Laplace and Elroy escorted Xoblob to The Laughing Lass. Getting directed to a recently retired employee, with Xoblob getting a Business 101 lecture from the duo, they managed to convince Amara for the last item for Xoblob’s ritual. \nArriving back at the shop, the two assisted the strange man in the ritual, creating **Robot Xoblob**, however, due to some error, accidently created a **Rogue Robot Xoblob**. After the novice adventures saved him once again, Xoblob kept his promise giving them the anti-poison vials, and the party offered to help him out again in the future if ever called upon. \n\nMeeting up with Jamie on The High Road, the trio made their way to Trollskull Alley where they met yet another foe – a barreling, out of control book trolley, that the **Three Urchins** decided to take a joyride on as a ‘prank’ at the expense of **Ayelet Moore**, an intern working for Rishaal the Page-turner. Teaching the kids a lesson and making acquaintances with Ayelet, the group attempted to get some well-deserved rest but were interrupted by a man claiming to be **Mark Genistar**, who was here to collect his lost wedding ring, found by Jamie. After the party refused to give it to him, he sicked his noble guards on them.\n\nAs battle ensured, they were assisted by a mysterious Giant Spider, who Jamie was familiar with. The new face, **Vernon** proved to be incredibly helpful in assisting the party evade the danger. After making acquaintances with each other, they learnt the truth of Mark Genistar. He was a charlatan trying to make some money who had recruited some noble guards who were recently fired by **House Adarbrent**. Alerting the city watch, including a young friend of Elroy’s, **Carrion Cromley**, the officers took away the criminals, leaving behind their stollen carriage and horse. Speaking with said horse, whom they named Sire, they learnt he was stolen from the Sea Maiden’s Faire. Buying him some fresh apples, and inviting him in, the party finally got their sleep.",

    "description": "Awaking on their third day in the Manor, Jamie and Laplace found themselves the only two awake. Venturing into the basement, they found Lif's hidden stash of expensive Amnian Wine. After a brief encounter with Lif himself, allowing them to learn that this was the last thing he did before his disappearance, the duo set off to sell Lif's last few bottles.\nAfter a brief interaction with Emmek Frewn, they decided to meet with PI, **Mr. Vincent Trench**. He offered to tell them everything he knew about Lif if they helped with a simple Missing Person’s case of a lost little girl. Agreeing to it, they instead headed straight to The Yawning Portal. Selling the rest of their wine to Durnan for an exorbitant price, and making a strong impression on his cat, before finally following up on their lead.\n\nMaking their way to the girl’s house in the __Field Ward__, they met **Agatha Elron**, who along with her husband **Michael** hadn’t seen their daughter **Ella** since the night prior. Mentioning she occasionally hung out at the __Half Barrel Tavern__, a few streets over, they decided to investigate there. Swiftly arriving, they met the owner, **Leanna Wright**, who was trying to get her hungover patrons (including **Miles**) to leave so she could close down. When asked about Ella, she mentioned that she usually saw her hanging around with **Biv the Butcher**. She didn’t quite like Ella as she was loud and always distracted Biv, but mentioned Biv was also missing and it was quite unlike him to miss his shift the night prior at the tavern. Miles mentioned that Biv was weird and creepy and didn’t have a very good reputation.\n\nMaking their way to Biv’s slum, a few blocks over, near a recently burnt-down house, they started searching the area. Using his new wand, Jamie uncovered Biv’s private Journal, whilst Laplace managed to find a potion and a key to the City of the Dead (COTD). Using the information they found, they traced Biv to the COTD. On their way, they had a run-in with a strange, but impressive mechanical creation with 8 halos that was running errands for its master. Continuing on, they managed to get into the COTD, where, after a bit of searching they found Ella, hiding atop a tree branch, with an injured leg, with a couple of Spined Devils dead on the floor beneath her. Two, however, were still alive, and were wandering around looking for her. At the base of the tree, propped up against the trunk was the body of a large, burly elderly man, covered in blood. Biv. \n\nThe duo decided to engage with the Devils that were strangely populating the COTD, and after successfully slaying them saved Ella. She told them what happened: She broke her leg jumping a log and Biv decided she was safer with him than alone. He took her with him to the COTD, telling stories on the way, offering his staff as a crutch. But, after a while at Biv’s grandmother’s grave, Biv realized something was not right. Seeing movement out the corner of his eye he turned to see a horde of Spined Devils break off from a group of cultists in the distance and heading towards him and Ella. With nothing but a knife on him, and an injured child to care for, he quickly rushed her towards a tree and hoisted her up into its limbs. It was only as she reached the branch that he felt the first shot of pain sear though his shoulder. Swinging round he fought the devils back, giving Ella time to climb high into the branches. It was as she found safety that he succumbed to his wounds, dying at the base of the tree.\n\nHaving managed to save the girl, they contacted two City Watch Officers, **Charles** and **Xavier**, who took Biv’s body to a nearby Dead House, and report the Devil bodies. Taking Ella back to her family, and joining them for breakfast, they then delivered the news to Leanna – who didn’t take it all to well. With an intense start to the morning, it was just about sunrise and the crew made their way back to Trollskull Manor.",

With some brief investigating, they decided to give Sire back to the Faire. As they returned, however, they were quickly alerted to the cries of **Squiddy** who was desperately trying to get help saving her friends **Nat** and **Jenks** - both trapped in a Dead House. Immediately rising to the occasion, Vernon and Elroy, who weren't even familiar with each other both raced into action.\n\nArriving at the __Dead House of Kelemvor__, they noticed it had been cordoned off by **Captain Staget** due to it suddenly infesting with aggressive plants with large vines and fungi continually expanding outward, threatening all surrounding buildings, and people closeby. The owner, **Rarder Cyne**, a Cleric of Kelemvor was desperately trying to get in to save his two trapped Acolytes, as well as the Urchins.\n\nMaking their way to the centre, they found the body of origin. Using clues, they visited the __Amethyst Hunters Guild Clubhouse__, an elite club formed by city nobles with a lot of spare time and not much respect for animal wildlife, who are hunting enthusiasts, competing socially for recognition and hunting trophies. Here, they met **Lord Arna Silverwood**, who eventually gave them the name and address of the body; **Thezuef Erneyn**, and helped them with another clue, directing them to a ship in __Mistshore__- the dilapidated North shore of Waterdeep's harbor. Visiting Thezuef’s house, they learnt of the spirit **Zielaph**, and some disturbing information. Heading to a ship in Mistshore – a place considered so dangerous the City Watch refused to send patrols into the area. Finding a Xanathar owned ship, dealing in illicit plants and drugs, including an addictive drug known as __Traveler's Dust__ as well as a reportedly dangerous plant taken from the __Darkvein__ Residence, known as the __Serpent’s Coil__. Having acquired the required materials for the ritual, the two managed to put an end to Zielaph’s Curse, freeing the cursed individuals as well as freeing Zielaph’s spirit itself. Leaving nothing but a small seed, the pair decided to grow it in a little pot plant. They then decided to head home, as the run started to rise.",

Elroy, who was running some errands was a bit late, but each group had something they wanted to talk about. Ergo, The Round Table Meeting. \n\nPulling four chairs around the one working table, the four previously unacquainted individuals pilled all their valuables in the middle, and were asked to place all their cards on the table. Each going around, they explained their story in Waterdeep and all came to the realisation what exactly they were facing. Diving up the coin they had equally amongst each other, they agreed to work together for now, helping each other. Vernon, then receiving a note from the Emerald Enclave, requested to spar Jamie to test his capabilities, whilst Laplace had a quick visit to Mr. Vincent Trench. \nDuring this time, they were visited by a kind elven man named **J.B. Nevercott**, a haberdasher who wanted to thank them for helping out a friend of his. He offered them a discount on his clothes tailorships in exchange from them helping him and his business out every now and then. After the deal was made, two if his tailors were sent to take measurements – one of which certainly had an interesting reaction to Marie.\n\nDeciding to head down to The Market, the group did a lil shoppin before Vernon started leading them somewhere special in the Southern Ward.",

    "description": "Departing from the busy market, Vernon guided the contrived party of misfits to a two-story manor lavishly decorated with pillars and enclosed within high, fancy walls; __Phaulkonmere__. A Phaulkon family member was surprised to see the party at her doorstep. While leaving, the party ran into a groundskeeper, **Melannor**, who guided the party to a tree. Next thing they knew, they were in a wooden room with tables and chairs – however every single thing was made from the same wooden source, almost as if the entire room was grown inside a tree. \n\nThey then met **Aina Lefaliir**, an archdruid elf and a the leader of the Emerald Enclave. After apologising for gathering intel on the party prior – due to the spies enthralled in the city from both the Guild and Zhents causing the inability to trust anyone, she then explained why they were invited: The Enclave sought to destroy the vile corruption growing within the city, as well as destroy the devils and the Cult of Asmodeus. She also offered to sponsor their trip to Skullport and offer additional information if they decided to join. \n\nWith Laplace and Jamie against, Elroy agreed to work with them whilst Vernon became an official member. Elroy and Vernon were taken in to meet an entity who used to be known as **Jeryth Phaulkon**. A demi-god, who, when died, was chosen by a great deity to lead of the Enclave. The disembodied voice thanked them for their willingness to work with them, and bestowed upon them a *Charm of Restoration*, also offering a safe haven to members. Re-entering the meeting room, **Eyeballs and Alaine** were also there, working with the Enclave to free their friends and family.\n\nLeaving, the crew headed to Xoblob’s where Laplace offered him a present whilst Vernon was formally introduced to him. On their way out they were interrupted by a speeding City Watch carriage that swerved to a stop right in front of them. Two fancy dressed men, one short, the other tall disembarked and introduced themselves:\n\n**Detective Barnibus Blastwind** of the Watchful Order and **Detective Saeth Cromley** of the City Watch. They questioned Jamie as they had a witness report of a “small bandaged boy” in the area around the time of Lord Ilzimmer’s death. After thorough questioning, they let him go, telling him not the leave town.\n\nElroy, with the help of Laplace decided to head to __Mother Tamra’s House of Pleasure and Healing__ to check up on **Sabbit** who had been quite injured by the Guild. On their way, through the bustling streets, Elroy noticed he’d been pick-pocketed; and the Black Vipers calling card sitting in his pocket. Whilst at the fancy building which served as a healing and rest centre, with clerics, spas and a fancy mechanical robot with 8-halos for a head working as a housecleaner, Elroy found his old friend bedridden from injuries. After having a little talk, and some angry poor injured people nagging him, he offered them his remaining coins before leaving.\nOn the other hand, Jamie and Vernon headed to the __Waterdeep Wazoo__ to talk to **R.R.Rudderson** on information they obtained. Getting his payment, Jamie got a *Capture*, a magic item that allows him to capture a moment in time and get photos of the Shard Shunners.\n\nHeading to the City of the Dead, where they agreed to meetup, Jamie and Laplace found a groundkeeper who guided them to Lif and Marie Adarbrents graves. On his way out, Laplace had a quick run-in with Maries teacher who was teaching Marie to help others, and was now trying to do so herself. As they get back, they notice a very distressed Griffon with a City Guard riding towards them. Crashlanding in front of Vernon and Elroy, Vernon managed to calm down the very distressed beast while the Griffon Rider ran off to the toilet. \nOn their way home, Jamie & Laplace made a quick stop at the Swordmaiden, where they found a Halfing written note left by the Shunners. Joining the crew back at the manor for a good sleep.",
