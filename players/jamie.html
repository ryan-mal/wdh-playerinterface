                <p class="detail-content">
                    Born to the noble House Darkvein in Waterdeep, Jamie spent his childhood in a mansion near Carran in the Ardeep Forest. His parents, Brulam and Sadie Darkvein, were co-founders of the Waterdeep faction of the Emerald Enclave, serving as diplomats between Waterdeep and Carran while secretly protecting a rare devil ritual component known as the Serpent's Coil.

                <p class="detail-content">
                    One fateful night, Jamie awoke to chaos. His parents, frantically destroying documents, sent him fleeing to Carran with a strange cloak. As he escaped, he heard the sound of their door being broken down and glimpsed red eyes in the darkness. The next day, he learned of a devil attack on Carran, recognizing the red eyes of one of the slain creatures.

                    Returning to find his parents missing and his home in ruins, Jamie encountered a Dryad bound to his father's favorite tree. Naming her Divona, she became his caretaker, maintaining the house with magic. When Jamie fell ill, Divona created special bandages from her own energy to keep him alive. Over the years, he immersed himself in arcane knowledge and his father's technological research.

                    Years later, Jamie learned his friend Cernunn was in danger in Waterdeep. Before departing to save him, Divona revealed a secret basement filled with Serpent's Coils, the infernal flowers his parents had protected. Armed with this knowledge and his honed skills, Jamie set out for Waterdeep, ready to confront the mysteries of his past and the dangers that await.
