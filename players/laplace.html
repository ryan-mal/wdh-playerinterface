                <p class="detail-content">
                    Born Laplace Rosznar on Ches 19, 1476, into the notorious House Rosznar of Waterdeep. Despite their affluence, the family faced significant prejudice, leading to their exile. They sought refuge in their ancestral vineyards in Amn, where they were met with disdain. This marked a turning point for young Laplace, as his beloved sister Esvele abruptly left on his tenth birthday, leaving only a pocket watch as a promise of connection.

                <p class="detail-content">
                    At fourteen, burdened by his family's declining fortunes and societal contempt, Laplace stowed away in a wine barrel, fleeing north. He discarded his Rosznar identity, adopting the name Laplace Klei. His na√Øve understanding of money quickly led to destitution, driving him to seek refuge in the perceived selflessness of a monastery. He joined the Sammasamutaito Monastery, hoping to find genuine kindness and support.

                <p class="detail-content">
                    At the monastery, Laplace grew close to Master Hakim, finding a semblance of the familial bond he had lost. However, his trust was shattered when he was manipulated into administering a lethal potion to a young girl, Marie Aderbrant, believing it to be a life-saving cure. Marie's death implicated the monastery in a dark plot, leading to its destruction and Laplace's capture by the Harpers.

                <p class="detail-content">
                    After intense interrogation, the Harpers, led by Mirt, recognized Laplace's innocence and released him. They suggested he seek a new beginning, hinting at finding purpose in the Yawning Portal. Now, Laplace navigates the shadows of Waterdeep, his experiences having taught him to rely on his understanding of wealth and intentions over simple trust, as he seeks to uncover the truth behind his past and forge a new future.
